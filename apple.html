				A new iPhone 12 Pro Max video brings the CAD renderings and leaks to life. The video from is from YouTuber EverythingApplePro, who cites reliable leaker Max Weinbach as his source. The video shows Apple's 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max with flatter sides, a built-in LiDAR scanner, flatter edges and a smaller notch. And it's all wrapped up in a slightly taller but thinner design than the iPhone 11 Pro Max.
				Other outlets have played down the potential for a radical redesign. One leak via MacOtakara cites a rumor within the Asian supply chain which claims that the design of the iPhone 12 will not be that different from the iPhone 11, using the same curved rail design â€” although with a thinner depth, greater height and smaller bezels to increase screen space.
				The notch that's become so familiar since Apple introduced it on the iPhone X will likely still be there on the iPhone 12, but it could be smaller, according to the MacOtakara report.

				A separate tweet from Apple watcher Jon Prosser says that Apple will manage to shrink the notch on the iPhone 12 by moving the speaker up into the phone's top bezel.

				Another rumor says that Apple will spice things up by offering a blue color for the iPhone 12. The blue would replace the Midnight Greem color offered on the iPhone 11 Pro and may be exclusive to the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max.
				But not everyone believes the notch is here to stay. Benjamin Geskin, who comes up with a lot of phone renders based on leaks and rumors, has put out a render of a 6.7-inch iPhone that drops the notch and instead houses the iPhone's TrueDepth camera components inside a thin bezel. Geskin tweeted that this is a prototype for a 2020 iPhone model. In a subsequent tweet, Geskin said Apple's testing out Face ID prototypes that feature components capable of fitting in the phone's top bezel, though there's no source attributed to that claim.
